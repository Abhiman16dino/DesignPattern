## 🎯 Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. This repository provides clean, well-documented implementations of popular design patterns, making it easier to understand and apply these patterns in real-world projects.

## 🔧 Design Patterns Implemented

### Creational Patterns
- **Builder Pattern** - Constructs complex objects step by step with a fluent interface

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Composite Pattern** - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Proxy Pattern** - Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it

### Behavioral Patterns
- **State Pattern** - Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes
- **Null Object Pattern** - Provides a default object to avoid null reference exceptions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DesignPattern.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DesignPattern
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE

## 💻 Usage

Each design pattern is implemented in its own package with:
- Complete implementation of the pattern
- A Main.java file demonstrating the pattern usage
- A readme.md file explaining the pattern and its use case

To run any pattern example:
1. Navigate to the specific pattern's directory
2. Compile and run the Main.java file
3. Observe the pattern implementation in action
